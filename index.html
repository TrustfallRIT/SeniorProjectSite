                    The purpose of the project is to automate employer and student interactions during career fairs.
                    This includes signing up for and signing into interviews. Employers will be able to create as many
                    schedules as they need depending on how many interviewers they decide to bring to the interview day.
                    After deciding which students they will interview, employers will be able to schedule the students
                    on any of their schedules as long as the student is available during the chosen interview block.
                    Each student will also have their own schedule which will let them view and check into interviews.
                    When a student checks into an interview, the interviewer gets notified via a change in the status of
                    the interview object on their schedule. The studentâ€™s schedule view will also help the student know
                    where to go for their interview by including details such as the location where they will be
                    interviewed.

                                central focus until it is complete. If needed, the MVP can be adjusted during the weekly
                                sponsor meetings in light of unexpected bugs or unpredicted necessary features. In
                                addition to the MVP, the team will maintain a backlog of features that would improve the
                                application beyond the necessities. If time permits, the team will implement these
                                features in order of importance dictated by the sponsor. If at any point one of these
                                features is deemed necessary for the MVP, it can be added to the MVP but possibly in
                                exchange for a different feature given development time restraints.
